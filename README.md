# Poker Challenge by Bruno Monteiro

## Project
To create a simple Poker Game to demonstrate my coding skills. The focus of this project was to create the proper "Backend" support for the Poker Game, not the User Interface.

That said, a very simple UI was created to facilitate the view of the classes and methods implemented in the "Backend".

## Technology
This project was made using `Typescript` and `ES6`. The reason behind is the ability that those languages provide to use classes and types, which would be closer to a Backend approach.

## Folder and Files
The `src/` folder contains the important files, including the classes, interfaces, constants and helpers.

**Note:** *The `main.ts` file is used only to render the UI*.

## How to Run
This project uses Node and NPM. After installing NPM, navigate to the project folder and run:

`npm install`

and

`npm run build`

Then a `dist/` folder will be created. Inside it, you will find a `index.html` file that may be open in any browser.

To run **Unit Tests** :
`npm run test`
